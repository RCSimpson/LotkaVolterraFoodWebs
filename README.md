We can model complex predator-prey dynamics through systems of differential equations. These sometime exhibit chaotic behavior. By simply increasing the dimensionality from two to three
we introduce the possibility of chaos.

The programs and notebook produce plots and animations of these dynamical systems. 

At this time Github or Nbviewer do not allow the animations to be viewed through their UI. To view the animations one must download the notebook or run the python files.
